Simple Python HTML Web Scraper  v0.01


Script that scraped html into an excel spreadsheet given a specific tag. Used to automate some work at an internship.

This was an early prototype version of a web scraper developed in 2013 used for testing. 

Complete version ofscraper is long gone since the computer it was developed on was stolen.
This was an early backup found on a USB drive.

Possibly will re-make the scraper in the future if application needed or out of interest.
