Simple Python HTML Web Scraper  v0.01


Early prototype version of a web scraper script that scraped html into an excel spreadsheet given a specific tag.

Final complete version is gone since the computer it was developed on was stolen and an old external hard drive that had the backup failed. 

Found this one on an old USB drive. Saving it to github for posteriority and re-developing it in the future.
